## DISCLAIMER : The number assigned next to the files for example, index (3).js, is not the file name. File name is index.js, since due to many files of same name, Github doesnt allow to have files of same name uploaded even if they are under different category (untill unless you dont put that file under a folder on Github). So to run under your local machine save that file name accordingly.
